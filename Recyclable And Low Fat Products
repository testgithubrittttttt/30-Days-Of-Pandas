import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df' containing product data

# Filter products based on low_fats and recyclable
filtered_df = df[(df['low_fats'] == 'Y') & (df['recyclable'] == 'Y')]

# Select product_id
result_df = filtered_df[['product_id']]

# Print the result (optional)
print(result_df)


Explanation:

- Import pandas: We import the pandas library.

- Filter Products: We use boolean indexing to filter the DataFrame (df).
   - We create a condition where low_fats must be equal to 'Y' (== 'Y') and recyclable must also be equal to 'Y' (== 'Y').
   - The & operator represents the logical AND between these conditions.

- Select product_id: We select the 'product_id' column from the filtered DataFrame and store it in result_df.

- Print Result (optional): This line is for demonstration purposes. It prints the resulting DataFrame containing only the product_id for products that are both low-fat and recyclable.
